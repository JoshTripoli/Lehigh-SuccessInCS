<h3 id="tips"><span style="">Tips For Success in CS</span></h3><br>
<p><span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">Whether you are in an introductory or high level CS class, here are some tips to help you succeed in your Computer Science classes!</span><br></p>
<p></p>
<h4><em>How Do You Define Success?</em></h4>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-95b50340-7fff-1ae7-c3f3-bf698cd2ce49"></b></p>
<p>Many students define success as being able to get high scores, maybe an A or B, with as little effort as possible. After all, the current education system places great emphasis on efficiency through standardized testing and designated curriculums which
    give learning a timeline and values the product of meeting benchmarks over the process of individual learning. So, it is no wonder success is often thought of as good grades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, here we will be defining “Success in CS” as mastering the concepts and skills being taught in your CS classes, as well as finding meaning in your CS studies. The tips presented here will help you achieve these goals and get the most out of your
    classes. They are by no means “short cuts” and will take effort. If you master these things, it normally follows that you will get good grades as well.</p>
<h4><em>1) Go To Class&nbsp;</em></h4>
<p>During class, Professors share explanations, stories, and applications of concepts that serve as a foundation for learning helping you make connections between topics and learn. Examples in class are always better understood when you’re in class following
    your professor rather than up all night the night before a big project/exam is due to watch all the recorded lectures. When in class, try to make the most of it by being an engaged and active participant. Taking effective notes can help you focus
    and pay attention. Complete all readings and start assignments before class so that you are prepared and class doesn’t become confusing. Class time is also a great time to ask questions about assignments or material.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>2) Practice&nbsp;</em></h4>
<p dir="ltr">To fully understand and get the hang of programming topics, it will take more than just going to class. It's the same as learning anything else-a foreign languages, sports, etc. Just observing someone else do something is enough to be able to fully understand
    something yourself. Practice is what allows you to really test your understanding and get hands on with your learning. By applying and reinforcing what you learned in class, you are able to make long-lasting learning that won’t be forgotten after
    the final exam.</p>
<h4><em>3) Get Started on Assignments ASAP&nbsp;</em></h4>
<p dir="ltr">Getting started early allows you to time to process the concepts and complete the assignment to your full potential. This is in stark contrast to procrastination where waiting until as late as possible puts you in a stressful situation that makes it difficult
    to learn and often leads to cheating which not only gets you in trouble but also cheats yourself out of learning. Some ways to start assignments early include making a schedule and keeping track of due dates can help you. Try to work daily and complete
    small chunks of assignments gradually rather then all at once right before the deadline. Ideally, you are taking Computer Science classes because it is something that you are excited to get to do. Don’t fear failure or think you don’t know enough
    to start. Sometimes the first step of a programming project like setting up the files could be a huge roadblock in making any progress for the assignment and starting early allows you to get help early to get unstuck. There are many things you will
    have to try to figure out yourself, and starting earlier gives you the time necessary to do this.</p>
<h4><em>4) Do Your Own Programming&nbsp;</em></h4>
<p dir="ltr">Getting others to do your work may save you time in the short-term, but you won’t be learning and will be breaking academic honesty and sabotaging yourself. A lot of the CS classes build on each other, and in a CS interview you will have to explain everything
    yourself so being dependent on others sets you up for failure. You are smart! Struggling on a homework assignment is expected. It will be worth it in the end when you figure it out and have a much deeper understanding. Additionally, exams and subsequent
    assignments often are like homework with slight differences so if you understand the homework you will be in a really good place for these tasks.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><em>5) Explore Your Interests</em></h4>
<p>Learning is a continual process that doesn't have to stop once class is over. One way to explore your interests in Computer Science is to try and think of a project and then start researching the technologies needed to implement it. Computer Science is
    a large diverse field with many niches which require different knowledge and skill sets, so working on projects you are interested in will help you learn more. Also, consider trying to learn something new and outside of your comfort zone, maybe something
    you have heard about but don't really know anything about. You may discover it to actually be something you like! Lastly, try to get involved with Lehigh's clubs and organizations that align with your interests, or even make your own. More information
    about this can be found in the next section labeled "Lehigh On-Campus Resources".&nbsp;</p><br>
